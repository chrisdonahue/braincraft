LONG TERM LIBRARY IDEAS:
  paramCheck()
  create jython testing interface for running experiments in python
  create coherent package structure
	change weight mutation
	Multithreading/rtNEAT
	Talk to neurobiologist about how we learn over the course of our lifetime.
	^ + alter weights/structure within the span of evaluation? Evolve phenotype then adapt it
	Alter weights in response to positive or negative events
	Earn right to reproduce in lifetime?
	leaky neural net evaluation
  BIAS nodes

FORKPOPULATION:
	implement DNA(DNA) constructor
	finish repopulate method

TRIBEPOPULATION:
  Merge getNewTribeID() and registerTribe() (as well as gene/node equivalents in population)
	Kill stagnant tribes
	Champion of each tribes with size >= 5 copied to next gen

VISUALIZER:
	Rearrange GUI
	Save nets as files
	Info boxes while Crafting
	Mutations/Children lists

EXPERIMENTS:
	Cryptography (Breaking bad code?)
	Music chord progressions with different fitness (like database or user evaluated)
	Tempo detector from raw audio samples
	Music Visualizer with grid of squares controlled by real time-evaluated brains. User taps to add or maybe subtract fitness. Brains can be saved and swapped out. Weights can be modified at visualization time. Maybe the brain can even take over screen real estate as it gets better. Endless possibilities!
